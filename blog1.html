        <p>I have been contemplating on where I would like to volunteer for my Service Learning hours. I am an extrovert, meaning, I typically prosper in any environment I am thrown in. “ Throw me to the wolves, and I will return leading the pack ”. Of course, it is not that serious. However, In order to make this Service Learning experience worthwhile and beyond the academic scope, I have my eyes on something memorable, raw, different, and most importantly diversified as it is enjoyable. Unfortunately, my visions is not entire up to par with my determination to succeed. If I am being pragmatic here, I do not know too many (if any) organizations that hit those merits. <br><br>
Place in mind:<strong> Project Focus</strong>. <br><br>

        <p>Project Focus peaked my interest from the jump (slang for start or beginning)! Initially, I was completely oblivious to the existence of Project Focus. Yet, my fellow companions, a plethora for that matter, in some shape or form have had some pre-exposure to Project Focus prior to class. Project Focus is a program at the University of Arizona that helps individuals with intellectual disabilities foster their growth by partnering them with students with no disabilities to increase each students independence, quality of life, and employability. I think this will be an amazing experience for me because it will allow me to not only be a teacher, student, and friend all in one, but exploit me to a different experience.  My neighbors daughter, whom I love and admire like a sister, deals with intellectual disabilities. I am confident this will open new avenues for me to express myself and have a better understanding of how to approach and handle situations better. My goal by the end of this program is to cultivate enough knowledge and understanding to approach more individuals with disabilities and just have a good time with them like I do with my regular friends.</p>

        <p>You’re probably asking yourself (even if you are not, lets role play here) ” That is great and all, but what can we expect? ”. I am so glad you asked. Let me tell you all about it. One of representatives kindly asked me if I would be interested in being involved in the technological aspect of the organization (web developer, to be precise). Which I am super dooper ooper smooper stoked about! This gives my blog the opportunity to have technical terms as well as human interaction. I will transition between both worlds and share my experiences.<br><strong>The good with the bad!</strong><br> Be on the lookout and stay up to date. <br><br>
